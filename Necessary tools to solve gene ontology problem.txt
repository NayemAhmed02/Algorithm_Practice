                                 Phase : A (GOATools Library)


1. First of all, we can't solve this problem with ordinary python library.

2. For solving this problem, we need an advance pyton library named GOATools .

3. This tool enables us to parse the Gene Ontology (GO) OBO file.

4. Now, the question is how to install the GOATools on your ANACONDA.

5. It's simple. just open your anaconda prompt and write "pip install goatools" (without double quotation) then press Enter

6. It takes sometimes. Then GOATools automatically install on your ANACONDA.

7. Lets try.

                                Phase : B (wget and os Library)


1. We also Require two more libraries wget and os,in order to download the GO OBO file.

2. Now, the question is how to install the wget and os libraries on your ANACONDA.

3. Don't worry about it. They are already automatically installed on your anaconda, when you installed GOATools.
