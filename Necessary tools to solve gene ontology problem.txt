1. First of all, we can't solve this problem with ordinary python tools .

2. For solving this problem, we need an advance pyton tool named GOATools .

3. This tool enables us to parse the Gene Ontology (GO) OBO file.

4. Now, the question is how to install the GOATools on your ANACONDA.

5. It's simple. just open your anaconda prompt and write "pip install goatools" (without double quotation) then press Enter

6. It takes sometimes. Then GOATools automatically install on your ANACONDA.
